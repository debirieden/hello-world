# hello-world
Hello fellow humans!

I'm getting started with GitHub.   Going through the tutorial.

I'm supposed to write about myself.

I like math.  I programmed for years, quite a few years ago.
Recently I haven't written one line of code, but want to get back into it.
So, here I am.

I like snowboarding, playing soccer, archery and trying new things.
I have twin boys who I adore, and spend time with them.

I love dogs and have had many throughout my life.
I had to put my black lab, his name is Bart, down in August of 2016.
It was a very sad day for me.  He was a great dog and lots of fun.

I currently have 2 male sugar gliders, named Lightning and Striker.  They are super cute.
I am amazed at how much they can poop.
I haven't put the time into socializing them, so they are timid.
My boys wanted them, and promised that they would feed them, take care of them, clean their cage.
If you have kids, your kids probably promised the same things to you.
Well, I fell for it.  They did try to help out at first, but lost interest.
We have had them for 5 years.  They are nocturnal and at night they sometimes 'bark', and are extremely loud.

I like cheeseburgers, kale, wine, vodka, salad, brownies, and other kinds of food.
Wanted to throw this in, why not.  

Who reads this anyway?
